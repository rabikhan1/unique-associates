                        <h4>Your responsibilities</h4>
                        <p>We are not an estate agency and we provide a service whereby agents may market and you may view property details ('Details') together with other content hosted and developed by us. Agents are responsible for preparing the Details and fielding enquiries directly from you. We do not get involved in any communications between you and agents and we do not participate in any part of the transaction.
                            <br />
                            Details are hosted by us in good faith but are produced directly by agents and have not been verified by us. You are responsible for making your own enquiries and we provide no guarantee and accept no responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of any information contained within the Details.
                            <br />
                            You are responsible for checking, confirming and satisfying yourself as to the accuracy of any Details.
                            You are responsible for instructing a surveyor and obtaining legal advice before committing to any purchase.
                            You are responsible for ensuring that you act in good faith towards any other parties.<br /></p>
                        <h4>Availability of website</h4>

On occasion, necessary maintenance or upgrade work requires us to make the website and the Services unavailable without notice, but we aim to keep downtime to a minimum. We accept no liability for any interruption or loss of service. We reserve the absolute right to alter, suspend or discontinue any part of our website or the Services, including your access to it.
                            <br /></p>
